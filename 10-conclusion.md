## Conclusion

OK, we're out of time for today,
I just want to quickly wrap up and see where we got to.

We learned a ton of terminology.
We know now what the index is,
what branch pointers are,
what a detached head is,
what a SHA is.

And all this stuff will be handy to know
whether you go on to become a Git power user
or you try to keep it simple.
Either way, mistakes happen,
and now you have a head start on understanding the solutions.

But the main lesson here is, don't be too afraid of Git.
It's OK to be wary; it's true, it has all your work,
and there are dangerous commands.

In general, though, now that you know the vocabulary,
you don't have anything to be afraid of.
You can read and learn about the commands.
And you can experiment on your own.

Thanks for coming. I hope this was helpful.
